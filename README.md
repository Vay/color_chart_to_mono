# color_chart_to_mono
If you have color 2d plot with several lines with different colors, it is cool.
But if you need this graphic in mono, it is not cool, and you haven't data to plot it against, it is really bad.
In this situation i am looking the tools to help but i can't find and i write this small script for getting data from color chart

# documentation
it is not have a normal documentation(sad, but true).
